# snake game :snake:

In this project I built the **snake game** using **c** language.</br>
The mission of the player is to eat the apple ($).</br>
The player can move in all directions using the arrows on the keyboard.  <img src="https://webcomicms.net/sites/default/files/clipart/144582/arrow-key-cliparts-144582-6390076.jpg" widht="80" height="80"/></br>
          
If the snake hits one of the walls or itself - GAME OVER.</br>
